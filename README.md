# Oggy's ML Notes
---

this site will be used to deepen my understanding of machine learning, share my work, notes and guides. 
for the time being this is heavily inspired by the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/) by @[jph00](https://github.com/jph00) (Jeremy Howard)

will proabably import my notes from Obsidian.md as they are already in the Markdown format (i love it ;D)


enjoy meow
